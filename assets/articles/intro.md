**My posts primarily explore real-world and theoretical applications of econometric and statistical/machine learning techniques, but also whatever I am currently interested in or learning üòÅ. At the end of the day, I write to learn _and_ help others learn!**

_As a believer and beneficiary of knowledge sharing, I hope my articles make complex topics just a bit more accessible to all._

My articles are also available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jakepenzak) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/author/jakepenzak/).
