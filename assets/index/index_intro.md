I am a Senior Data Scientist at a retail data science company based in Cincinnati, OH, a persistent learner,
and, most importantly, a devoted friend, son, brother, and boyfriend.

<br>

My deep passion for data science was fostered and stimulated through my Master's studies in Economics at Miami University in Oxford, OH and,
prior to graduate school, my studies in Mathematics and Economics at the University of Dayton.

<br>

My fields of expertise concentrate heavily in applied econometrics, mathematical optimization, statistical/machine learning,
and bridging the conceptual gap between causal inference and predictive modeling.

<br>

In the professional sphere, I am dedicated to developing scalable & production-grade econometric,
causal inference, and machine learning solutions for measurement & personalized targeting within
the retail marketing industry, with expertise in both experimental and quasi-experimental settings.

<br>

Outside of work, I like developing python packages 🐍, exploring self-hosting & home networking + infrastructure design 🖥️,
sharing knowledge through blog bosts ✍️, spending time outdoors hiking and camping ⛺, playing the guitar 🎸, and
immersing myself in music—especially jam bands & improvisational jazz 🎼
